	\item[Self-Service Import Process\\\textnormal{Python, Powershell}]
		Built a self-service, \texttt{yaml}-configured import process for users of the Oracle DB. Used by the team across many projects. As of writing, has imported 600 files over 10 projects. \\
	\item[Sales Schema \textnormal{Oracle}] Created and managed physical schema in \textit{Oracle} with stored-procedures for \textit{ETL} and triggers for \texttt{MERGE} audit. Designed for performance and constant availability (indexes, relational design, normalisation). Customers of this data included Data Exploitation analysts and Business Managers, who provided data for upserts for automated ingestion and ETL.
	\item[Metadata Management] I am producing the vision for our Metadata Management solution. That is, \textit{what do we want our solution to look like?} This involves researching and interviewing to populate a Data Glossary, creating policies and rules, visualising  Data Lineage in the Metadata Repository (Atlas, Collibra, Watson Data Catalog)
	\item[Data Standards] Implemented standards for projects to meet in order to be further developed into production. 
	\item[Mentoring \textnormal{moving-ahead.org}] As part of a British Airways's initiative, I voluntarily mentored a colleague remotely over a 9 month period.
	\item[Vizualizations\\\textnormal{Tableau}] Visualized the time-series variances in percentage changes for each data ingestion. Assuming log-normal distribution, allowing us to visualize desirable and undesirable variances away from the mean.\\\\\
