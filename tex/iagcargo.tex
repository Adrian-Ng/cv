\begin{description}[style=multiline, leftmargin=3.5cm]
	\item[Prototype Implementation\\\textnormal{PL/SQL}] Implemented data processes originally prototyped by Data Exploitation team in \textit{Alteryx}/\textit{Tableau}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Reduced \textit{Flight} prototype from day-long Alteryx workflow to 15 minute \textit{SQL} process:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item Computed \textit{directed network graphs} with set-based iteration (\texttt{CROSS JOIN}, inline recursion)
			            \item Achieved a functional approach to returning sets by utilizing \texttt{record}, \texttt{table} types
			            \item Cached remote/computationally expensive datasets in \textit{global temp tables}, \textit{materialized views}
			            %\item Utilized PL/SQL like a functional language with table-valued functions
					\end{itemize}
		      \item Established standards for Data Exploitation prototypes to follow (documentation, UAT evidence)
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[Self-Service Pipeline Creation\\\textnormal{\texttt{Python\\Powershell\\YAML}}]
	      Built an automated service enabling Data Exploitation team to set up their own data pipelines.
	      \begin{itemize}
			  \item Adopted \texttt{YAML} for user-friendly configuration resulting in utilization across multiple projects
			  \item Underlying code (Python, Powershell) made use of object-oriented patterns and practices
			  \item Used time-series analysis (differencing) to visualize unusually large/small imports (\textit{Tableau})
		     \item Clear documentation (installation, configuration) led to continued use throughout Lockdown
		     \item Incorporated \texttt{git} into development and deployment workflow
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[Sales Data Model\\ \textnormal{PL/SQL\\Powershell}]
		Deployed a data model and ETL interface providing business stakeholders control over their data
		  \begin{itemize}		     
			\item Made use of \textit{snowflake} schema to model entity-relationships: account manager/customer/location 
		    \item Relational design resulted in efficient \texttt{MERGE}, constant uptime, and immediate retrieval
		    \item Co-opted \textit{Sharepoint} as user-friendly file system for ingress with \textit{Powershell} APIs (PnP)
		    \item Generalized this project into aforementioned \textit{Self-Service pipeline}
		    %\item 1
		    %\item 2
		    %\item 3
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[Training] Prepared training materials and hosted workshops (SQL fundamentals, Markdown)
	\item[Data Glossary] Established editorial guidelines for internal Wiki/Data Glossary. Interviewed others for content.
	\item[Mentorship] Mentored a colleague (\textit{moving-ahead.org}). Listened to issues, asked questions. Provided guidance.
