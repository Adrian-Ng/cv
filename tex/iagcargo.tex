\begin{description}[style=multiline, leftmargin=3.5cm]
	\item[Prototype Implementation\\\textnormal{PL/SQL}] Implemented data processes originally prototyped by Data Exploitation team in \textit{Alteryx}/\textit{Tableau}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Achieved efficiencies where possible:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item Computed \textit{directed network graphs} with set-based iteration (\texttt{CROSS JOIN}, inline recursion)
			            \item Cached remote/computationally expensive datasets in \textit{global temp tables}, \textit{materialized views}
			            \item Utilized PL/SQL like a functional language with table-valued functions.
		            \end{itemize}
		      \item Established standards for Data Exploitation prototypes to follow (documentation, UAT evidence)
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[Self-Service Pipeline Creation\\\textnormal{Python, Powershell}]
	      Built an automated service enabling Data Exploitation team to set up their own data pipelines.
	      \begin{itemize}
			  \item Adopting \texttt{yaml} for user-friendly configuration resulted in utilization across multiple projects
			  \item Underlying code (Python, Powershell) made use of object-oriented patterns and practices
			  \item Used time-series analysis (differencing) to visualize unusually large/small imports (\textit{Tableau})
		     \item Clear documentation (installation, configuration) led to continued use throughout Lockdown
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[Sales Relational Model\\ \textnormal{Oracle}]
	      Modelled the relationships between entities: sales agent/customer/location
	      \begin{itemize}		      
		      \item Relational design resulted in efficient ETL, constant uptime, and immediate retrieval
		      \item Co-opted \textit{Sharepoint} as ETL interface, facilitating data ownership for non-technical stakeholders
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[Training] Prepared training materials and hosted workshops (SQL fundamentals, Markdown)
	\item[Data Glossary] Established editorial guidelines for internal Wiki/Data Glossary. Interviewed others for content.
	\item[Mentorship] Mentored a colleague (\textit{moving-ahead.org}). Listened to issues, asked questions. Provided guidance.
