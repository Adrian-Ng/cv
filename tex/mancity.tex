	\item[NYCFC Data Integration \textnormal{Project Owner}]

	      Integrated New York City FC  data into our analytical warehouse.
	      Six-month project involving data discovery, analysis, engineering.
	      Multiple data sources were involved:
	      \begin{itemize*}
		      \item NYCFC
		      \item Ticketmaster
		      \item Salesforce
		      \item Major League Soccer
	      \end{itemize*}

		      \item[Data Pipeline]
		            {
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item built pipeline ingesting data from multiple databases, replacing \textit{Informatica} solution
			            \item achieved speed improvements using efficient DML \& DDL (\texttt{OPENQUERY}, \texttt{MERGE})
		            \end{itemize}
		            }

		      \item[Data Cubes]
		            Storing analytical datasets in \textit{Data Cubes} achieved
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item up-stream computation of all drill-down/roll-up levels and \texttt{GROUP BY} permutations
			            \item reduction in size of dataset, minimising bandwidth across distributed servers
			            \item improved user-experience in \textit{Tableau} front-end
		            \end{itemize}

		      \item[Mentoring]
		            Dedicating time to mentoring junior colleagues remotely in Manchester/New York
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item organised weekly workshops teaching basic DML and advanced DDL
			            \item developed additional material on my website to supplement these workshops
			            \item aimed towards self-sufficiency in writing database queries/stored procedures
		            \end{itemize}

	      \end{description}
	\item[GDPR Pipeline \textnormal{Technical Lead}]
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item integrated new GDPR schema into existing datastores (\textit{SQL}, \textit{Salesforce})
		      \item provide schema specification to \texttt{SQL} developers, advocating for indexable data types
		      \item built efficient \texttt{MERGE} process featuring relational database design
		      \item implemented a process to wipe personalised data belonging to any non-consenting individual stored in our data-warehouse
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[Customer Churn Model]
	      Modelling MCFC/NYCFC customers' future propensity to churn via \textit{logistic regression}.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item contributed to feature selection via:
		            \begin{itemize*}
			            \item data extraction
			            \item imputation
			            \item normalisation
			            \item \texttt{R} modelling
		            \end{itemize*}
		      \item researched alternate models (e.g. \textit{Beta-Geometric/Beta-Bernoulli}), academic papers, \texttt{R} APIs
	      \end{itemize}
