\textit{Dec. 2013 - Sept. 2016}
\begin{paragraph}
	I developed a number of \texttt{SQL} processes to transform customer data into CRM segments. On occasion, I took responsibility for resourcing and managing the team's workload in \textit{Jira}.

	\item[Virgin Media Segmentation \tiny\textnormal{\href{https://adrian.ng/SQL/recursion}{adrian.ng/SQL/recursion}} \textnormal{\href{https://adrian.ng/openquery-xml}{adrian.ng/openquery-xml}}]
	      Built a flexible segmentation process able to accommodate the numerous VM mailings and myriad ad-hoc configurations.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item wrote a flexible import process to efficiently ingest millions of tuples distributed across multiple flat-files, gaining time-savings over the built-in import wizard
		      \item achieved efficient joining of local and remote tables via use of \texttt{OPENQUERY}, \texttt{XML}, dynamic \texttt{SQL}
		      \item implemented efficient regex parsing via recursion, producing a one-to-many tuple mapping
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[Volkswagen Onboarding]
	      Worked with \texttt{.NET} developers and project managers to on-board a new client.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item implemented a new process for segmenting email \textit{and} SMS from scratch
		      \item provided schema specification to developers for data warehousing
	      \end{itemize}
	\item[TUI Redesign]
	      Collaborated with TUI to integrate a new, responsive design for \textit{Thomson} and \textit{First Choice} large deployment broadcasts (5M+ recipients)
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item wrote \texttt{TCL} optimised scripts for merging \texttt{HTML} documents in SQL tables.
		      \item tested, gave feedback, managed expectations on technical feasibilites
		      \item gained recognition with client and was awarded at the end of this three-month project
	      \end{itemize}
