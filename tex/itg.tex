	\item[ETL Process for CRM Broadcasts \tiny\textnormal{\href{https://adrian.ng/SQL/recursion}{adrian.ng/SQL/recursion}} \textnormal{\href{https://adrian.ng/openquery-xml}{adrian.ng/openquery-xml}}]
	      Built a configurable ETL process to ingest (via \texttt{BULK INSERT}), transform into CRM segments, and load into broadcast service (\textit{Lyris}). 
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item capable of multiple file ingestion, gained time-savings over the \textit{SQL Server} import wizard
		      \item achieved efficient joining of local and remote tables, using dynamic SQL to embed \texttt{XML} in \texttt{OPENQUERY}
		      \item implemented efficient regex parsing with recursive CTEs, mapping delimited strings to rows
	      \end{itemize}
	%\item[Volkswagen Onboarding]
	%      Worked with \texttt{.NET} developers and project managers to on-board a new client.
	%      \begin{itemize}
	%	      \item implemented a new process for segmenting email \textit{and} SMS from scratch
	%	      \item provided schema specification to developers for data warehousing
	%      \end{itemize}
	%\item[TUI Redesign]
	%      Collaborated with TUI to integrate a new, responsive design for \textit{Thomson} and \textit{First Choice} large deployment broadcasts (5M+ recipients)
	%      \begin{itemize}
	%	      \item wrote \texttt{TCL} optimised scripts for merging \texttt{HTML} documents in SQL tables.
	%	      \item tested, gave feedback, managed expectations on technical feasibilites
	%	      \item gained recognition with client and was awarded at the end of this three-month project
	%      \end{itemize}
