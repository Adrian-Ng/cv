\section{Profile}
\begin{paragraph}
	I am a Computer Science graduate passionate about Data Engineering and I seek opportunities that meet my growing experience in \textit{Java} -- a language I have used in numerous academic projects ranging from the implementation of financial models to large-scale data processing with \textit{Apache Hadoop MapReduce}.
	\par
	Prior to postgraduate study, my expertise was in \textit{SQL development} focusing on the implementation of segmentation processes for a number of clients including: \textit{Virgin Media}, \textit{TUI}, \textit{UPC}, \textit{MSD}, \textit{Volkswagen}, \textit{KwikFit}.
	\par
	After graduation, my most recent accomplishments as a Data Analyst at \textit{Manchester City FC} were in the technical parts (e.g. pipelines, architecture) of the projects I worked on, which leads me now to pursue a career in Data Engineering.

{Implementation of Value at Risk (VaR) measures in Java}
{
	(\href{https://adrian.ng/java/var/}{https://adrian.ng/java/var/})
	\quad
	(\href{https://github.com/Adrian-Ng/VaR}{https://github.com/Adrian-Ng/VaR})
}
{
	Assuming a number of hypothetical investment portfolios, my dissertation project implemented a number of approaches to estimating \textit{VaR}, a measure of risk, and variance/volatility (for model parameterization).
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {
		      \textbf{VaR:}
		      \begin{enumerate*}[label={\alph*)}]
			      \item \textit{Model Building}
			      \item \textit{Historical Simulation}
			      \item \textit{Monte Carlo Simulation}.
		      \end{enumerate*}
		      }
		\item {
		      \textbf{Variance/Volatility:}
		      \begin{enumerate*}[label={\alph*)}]
			      \item \textit{Equal Weighted}
			      \item \textit{Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)}
			      \item \textit{GARCH(1,1)}.
		      \end{enumerate*}

		      \begin{itemize*}
			      \item \textit{EWMA} lambda parameter taken from J.P. Morgan's \textit{RiskMetrics}.
			      \item \textit{GARCH(1,1)} parameters were found via \textit{Levenberg-Marquardt} optimisation.
		      \end{itemize*}

		      }
	\end{itemize}
	Because of these numerous approaches, object-oriented techniques and patterns were implemented.
	In addition, I used Java's concurrency APIs to parallelize the 100,000+ random walks generated by \textit{Monte Carlo} for simulating stock prices.
	Real world financial data was obtained via \textit{Google Finance} and \textit{Yahoo Finance APIs}.
}

\resumeSubItem{Option Pricing}
{
	(\href{https://adrian.ng/java/options/}{https://adrian.ng/java/options/}) \quad (\href{https://github.com/Adrian-Ng/OptionPricer}{https://github.com/Adrian-Ng/OptionPricer})
}
{
	This project implements three approaches to estimating option prices in Java:
	\newline
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Monte Carlo Simulation
		\item Black Scholes
		\item Binomial Trees
	\end{itemize*}
	\newline
	Apache Commons Math API was used to deal with some probabilistic assumptions.
}

\resumeSubItem{Data Mining with Hadoop MapReduce}
{
	(\href{https://github.com/Adrian-Ng/HadoopEnron}{https://github.com/Adrian-Ng/HadoopEnron})
}
{
	I wrote a number of \textit{MapReduce} applications in Java including extracting the communications network from the \textit{Enron Corpus}, a large dataset of emails, or aggregation of Twitter data.
	\newline
	Applications were exported and executed on \textit{Hadoop} clusters (both single node and distributed). Input/Output datasets were stored in HDFS and accessed via \texttt{hadoop fs} commands.
	\newline
	A subsequent exercise was undertaken to minimise the verbosity of these \textit{Hadoop MapReduce} applications by translating them to \textit{Scala} for use in a \textit{Spark REPL}.
}


\item {
	\textbf{Java 8 Streams with financial data}
	\hfill
	\tiny
	(\href{https://adrian.ng/java/yahoofinance/\#stream}{https://adrian.ng/java/yahoofinance/\#stream})
	\small
	A small exercise involving the use of \textit{Java 8 Streams}. Processing real-world financial data to return \textit{mean} and \textit{variance} of some market asset.
}


%		 \resumeSubItem{Google PageRank}{}
%		 {
%		   This is the implementation of Google's \textit{PageRank} algorithm. I simulate the behaviour of someone browsing a series of webpages by computing a transition matrix from an input graph and mixing a Markov Chain.

\textit{Jan. - July 2018}
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{New York City FC Project:}
	      I took ownership of this project to integrate \textit{NYCFC's} transactional and demographic data with \textit{City Football Group's} data-warehouse. This six-month project involved many phases including: discovery, engineering, and analysis. Data came from multiple external sources each with differing schema: \textit{NYCFC}, \textit{Ticketmaster} \textit{Salesforce}, \textit{Major League Soccer}.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Data Pipeline:}
		            I implemented a data pipeline to ingress data from a number of remote \textit{SQL} databases.
		            This process was encapsulated in \textit{stored procedures} which used appropriate DML \& DDL (\texttt{OPENQUERY}, \texttt{MERGE}) for efficient ETL.
		            This pipeline replaced the slower front-end  \textit{Informatica} solution.
		            }
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Data Cubes:}
		            I used an aggregated dataset to compare the distribution of \texttt{NULL} values. These analyses were transformed to \textit{Data Cubes} to pre-compute every possible roll-up/drill-down. As such, bandwidth was minimised across our distributed servers and need for real-time computation in \textit{Tableau} front-end was eliminated, resulting in improved user-experience.
		            }
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Mentoring:}
		            As part of this project, I was dedicated to mentoring a junior colleague remotely in New York. I organised weekly workshops to teach basic DML and more advanced DDL with a goal toward self-sufficiency in writing database queries and working with stored procedures. Additional material on my website helped supplement these workshops.
		            }
	      \end{itemize}
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{GDPR Stream Integration:}
	      I worked on the integration of a GDPR preference stream into our data stores (\textit{SQL}, \textit{Salesforce}). I implemented a new pipeline and refactored numerous processes downstream .
	      I worked with the development team to provided specification and UAT testing. I built an efficient, automated \texttt{MERGE} process using primary key constraints, clustered indexes, triggers.
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{Customer Churn Model:}
	      I contributed datasets and collaborated on feature/model selection. In particular, looking at \textit{logistic regression} and \textit{Beta-Geometric/Beta-Bernoulli} models in R Studio.

\textit{Dec. 2013 - Sept. 2016}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{
	      The majority of my work in this role involved working with SQL processes which were used to transform customer data into CRM segmentations. As senior team member, I developed a number of these processes. On occasion, I held responsibility for resourcing and managing the team's workload using \textit{Jira}.

	      \newline
	      \small
	      I built an end-to-end segmentation process in \textit{SQL}. This included building a fast, flexible, and bespoke import tool around \texttt{BULK INSERT}. Remote server queries (\texttt{OPENQUERY}) made use of \texttt{XML} to effectively \texttt{INNER JOIN} local and remote tables resulting in speed and minimial resource use on a busy live server. Recursive queries were used to implement a solution (similar to \texttt{flatMap} in \textit{Java 8}) for efficient \textit{regex}.
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{Volkswagen Onboarding:}
	      I worked with \texttt{.NET} developers and project managers to bring Volkswagen on-board as a new client. This required implementing a new segmentation process for broadcasting email \textit{and} SMS. In addition, I provided specification to developers for their data warehousing/archiving ingress schema.
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{TUI Redesign:}
	      I collaborated closely with the TUI client during a three-month project to redesign the existing \textit{Thomson} and \textit{First Choice} mailings.	\texttt{TCL} scripts were developed to merge dynamic content into the \texttt{HTML} body. My efforts on this project were awarded by the client.
