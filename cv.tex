%----------PROFILE-----------------
\section{Profile}
\begin{paragraph}
	I am a Computer Science graduate passionate about programming and a career in Data Engineering. I seek opportunities that meet my growing experience in \textit{Java} -- a language I have used in numerous academic projects ranging from the implementation of financial models to large-scale data processing with \textit{Apache Hadoop} and more.
	%In addition, \texttt{R} and \texttt{MATLAB} were used to implement various machine learning algorithms.
	\noindent
	\newline
	Prior to postgraduate study, my expertise in \textit{SQL development} focused on the implementation of segmentation processes for a number of clients including: \textit{Virgin Media}, \textit{TUI}, \textit{UPC}, \textit{MSD}, \textit{Volkswagen}, and \textit{KwikFit}.
	\noindent
	\newline
	After graduation, my accomplishments as a Data Analyst at \textit{Manchester City FC} leaned more towards Data Engineering, which leads me now to pursue a career in this field.

	      I implemented a number of approaches to estimating \textit{VaR}, a measure of risk, for a (hypothetical) investment portfolio (stocks, options, deltas). A Normal Distribution $N(0, \sigma^2)$ was assumed for daily price changes. Therefore, a number of moving average processes were implemented for estimating variance $\sigma^2$.
	      In addition, an implementation of the \textit{Levenberg-Marquardt} algorithm was used for optimisation of \textit{GARCH(1,1)} parameters.

	      I made use of object-oriented techniques and patterns to accommodate these numerous approaches.
	      In addition, I used \texttt{Java's} concurrency APIs to parallelize the 100,000+ random walks generated by \textit{Monte Carlo} when simulating stock prices.
	      Real world financial data was obtained via \textit{Google Finance} and \textit{Yahoo Finance} APIs.

	      \newline
	      \small
	      As part of the postgraduate module, \textit{Methods of Computational Fianance}, I implemented three approaches to estimating option prices:
	      \begin{itemize*}
		      \item Monte Carlo Simulation
		      \item Black Scholes
		      \item Binomial Trees.
	      \end{itemize*}
	      And where applicable, I computed the \textit{payoff} for American, Asian, and European options.
	      The Black Scholes approach assumes a Normal Distribution, so Apache Commons Math API was used.

	      \small
	      \newline
	      During my postgraduate module \textit{Large Scale Data Storage and Processing}, I wrote a number of \textit{MapReduce} applications. These involved mapping the communications network from a large collection of emails from the \textit{Enron Corpus} and the aggregation of \textit{Twitter} data.
	      I ran my applications on a self-hosted, single-node cluster as well as on the university's distributed cluster. To load/extract data in \textit{HDFS}, I used \texttt{hdfs dfs} commands.

		            \newline
		            In a self-imposed exercise, I translated some of these \textit{MapReduce} applications to \texttt{Scala}. This code was less verbose and ran in an \textit{Apache Spark REPL}, which could still interface with \textit{HDFS} via \texttt{sparkcontext} APIs.

	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{New York City FC Project:}
	      I took ownership of this project to integrate \textit{NYCFC's} transactional and demographic data with \textit{City Football Group's} data-warehouse. This six-month project involved many phases including: discovery, engineering, and analysis. Data came from multiple external sources each with differing schema: \textit{NYCFC}, \textit{Ticketmaster} \textit{Salesforce}, \textit{Major League Soccer}.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Data Pipeline:}
		            I implemented a data pipeline to ingress data from multiple databases.
		            This process was encapsulated in \textit{stored procedures} in which I wrote appropriate DML \& DDL (\texttt{OPENQUERY}, \texttt{MERGE}) for efficient ETL.
		            This pipeline replaced the slower front-end  \textit{Informatica} solution.
		            }
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Data Cubes:}
		            I used an aggregated dataset to compare the distribution of \texttt{NULL} values. These analyses were transformed to \textit{Data Cubes} to pre-compute every possible roll-up/drill-down. As such, bandwidth was minimised across our distributed servers and need for real-time computation in \textit{Tableau} front-end was eliminated, resulting in an improved user-experience.
		            }
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Mentoring:}
		            As part of this project, I dedicated time to mentoring a junior colleague remotely in New York. I organised weekly workshops to teach basic DML and more advanced DDL with a goal toward self-sufficiency in writing database queries and stored procedure implementation/scheduling. Additional material on my website helped supplement these workshops.
		            }
	      \end{itemize}
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{GDPR Preference Pipeline:}
	      I worked on the integration of a GDPR preference pipeline into our data stores (\textit{SQL}, \textit{Salesforce}) and the subsequent refactoring of numerous processes downstream.
	      I worked with the SQL development team and provided specification and UAT testing. I built an efficient, automated \texttt{MERGE} process using relational database design (primary key constraints, clustered indexes, triggers).
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{Customer Churn Model:}
	      In an intra-team project to estimate each customer's (MCFC, NYCFC) propensity to churn in following seasons, I assisted with feature selection, contributing to data extraction, imputation, and normalisation. Model selection landed on \textit{logistic regression} but I also researched alternate models (involving more probabilistic assumptions) such as \textit{Beta-Geometric/Beta-Bernoulli}; for which I looked at corresponding academic papers and implementation in \texttt{R Studio}.

\textit{Dec. 2013 - Sept. 2016\\}

\noindent
The majority of my work in this role involved working with \texttt{SQL} processes which were used to transform customer data into CRM segmentations. Having been promoted to the senior position, I developed a number of these processes. On occasion, I held responsibility for resourcing and managing the team's workload using \textit{Jira}.

	      \newline
	      \small
	      I built an end-to-end segmentation process in \texttt{SQL}. This included building a fast, flexible, and bespoke import tool around \texttt{BULK INSERT}. Remote server queries (\texttt{OPENQUERY}) made use of \texttt{XML} to effectively \texttt{INNER JOIN} local and remote tables resulting in speed and minimial resource use on a busy live server. Recursive queries were used to implement a solution (similar to \texttt{flatMap} in \texttt{Java 8} or \texttt{Scala}) for efficient regex.
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{Volkswagen Onboarding:}
	      I worked with \texttt{.NET} developers and project managers to bring Volkswagen on-board as a new client. This required implementing a new segmentation process for broadcasting email \textit{and} SMS. In addition, I provided specification to developers for their data warehousing/archiving ingress schema.
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{TUI Redesign:}
	      I collaborated closely with the TUI client to redesign the existing \textit{Thomson} and \textit{First Choice} mailings. \texttt{TCL} scripts were developed to dynamically merge fields into the \texttt{HTML} body.  For my efforts on this three-month project I gained recognition with the client and was rewarded.

Using \textit{SQL Server Management Studio} for the first time, I wrote DML capable of querying the transactional/customer databases to return data for warehousing, reporting, and segmentation. I also worked on pricing and spatial analyses, using \textit{QGIS} as a visualisation tool.
