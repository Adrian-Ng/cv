%----------PROFILE-----------------
\section{Profile}
\begin{paragraph}
	I am a Computer Science graduate passionate about programming and a career in Data Engineering. I seek opportunities that meet my growing experience in \textit{Java} -- a language I have used in numerous academic projects ranging from the implementation of financial models to large-scale data processing with \textit{Apache Hadoop}.
	\par
	Prior to postgraduate study, my expertise was in \textit{SQL development} focusing on the implementation of segmentation processes for a number of clients including: \textit{Virgin Media}, \textit{TUI}, \textit{UPC}, \textit{MSD}, \textit{Volkswagen}, and \textit{KwikFit}.
	\par
	After graduation, my recent accomplishments as a Data Analyst at \textit{Manchester City FC} learned more towards Data Engineering, which leads me now to pursue a career in this field.

		      \item Black Scholes
		      \item Binomial Trees
	      \end{itemize}
	      This assumes a given stock price, strike price, interest rate, volatility, and time to maturity.
	      Apache Commons Math API was used to deal with some probabilistic assumptions.

	      \newline
	      Applications were exported and executed on \textit{Hadoop} clusters (both single node and distributed). Input/Output datasets were stored in HDFS and accessed via \texttt{hadoop fs} commands.
	      \newline
	      A subsequent exercise was undertaken to minimise the verbosity of these \textit{Hadoop MapReduce} applications by translating them to \textit{Scala} for use in a \textit{Spark REPL}.

	      \textbf{New York City FC Project:}
	      I took ownership of this project to integrate \textit{NYCFC's} transactional and demographic data with \textit{City Football Group's} data-warehouse. This six-month project involved many phases including: discovery, engineering, and analysis. Data came from multiple external sources each with differing schema: \textit{NYCFC}, \textit{Ticketmaster} \textit{Salesforce}, \textit{Major League Soccer}.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Data Pipeline:}
		            I implemented a data pipeline to ingress data from a number of remote \textit{SQL} databases.
		            This process was encapsulated in \textit{stored procedures} which used appropriate DML \& DDL (\texttt{OPENQUERY}, \texttt{MERGE}) for efficient ETL.
		            This pipeline replaced the slower front-end  \textit{Informatica} solution.
		            }
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Data Cubes:}
		            I used an aggregated dataset to compare the distribution of \texttt{NULL} values. These analyses were transformed to \textit{Data Cubes} to pre-compute every possible roll-up/drill-down. As such, bandwidth was minimised across our distributed servers and need for real-time computation in \textit{Tableau} front-end was eliminated, resulting in improved user-experience.
		            }
		      \item
		            {
		            \textbf{Mentoring:}
		            As part of this project, I was dedicated to mentoring a junior colleague remotely in New York. I organised weekly workshops to teach basic DML and more advanced DDL with a goal toward self-sufficiency in writing database queries and working with stored procedures. Additional material on my website helped supplement these workshops.

	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{GDPR Stream Integration:}
	      I worked on the integration of a GDPR preference stream into our data stores (\textit{SQL}, \textit{Salesforce}). I implemented a new pipeline and refactored numerous processes downstream .
	      I worked with the development team to provided specification and UAT testing. I built an efficient, automated \texttt{MERGE} process using primary key constraints, clustered indexes, triggers.
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{Customer Churn Model:}
	      I contributed datasets and collaborated on feature/model selection. In particular, looking at \textit{logistic regression} and \textit{Beta-Geometric/Beta-Bernoulli} models in R Studio.

\textit{Dec. 2013 - Sept. 2016\\}

\noindent
The majority of my work in this role involved working with SQL processes which were used to transform customer data into CRM segmentations. Having been promoted to the senior position, I developed a number of these processes. On occasion, I held responsibility for resourcing and managing the team's workload using \textit{Jira}.

	      \newline
	      \small
	      I built an end-to-end segmentation process in \textit{SQL}. This included building a fast, flexible, and bespoke import tool around \texttt{BULK INSERT}. Remote server queries (\texttt{OPENQUERY}) made use of \texttt{XML} to effectively \texttt{INNER JOIN} local and remote tables resulting in speed and minimial resource use on a busy live server. Recursive queries were used to implement a solution (similar to \texttt{flatMap} in \textit{Java 8}) for efficient \textit{regex}.
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{Volkswagen Onboarding:}
	      I worked with \texttt{.NET} developers and project managers to bring Volkswagen on-board as a new client. This required implementing a new segmentation process for broadcasting email \textit{and} SMS. In addition, I provided specification to developers for their data warehousing/archiving ingress schema.
	      }
	\item
	      {
	      \textbf{TUI Redesign:}
	      I collaborated closely with the TUI client during a three-month project to redesign the existing \textit{Thomson} and \textit{First Choice} mailings.	\texttt{TCL} scripts were developed to merge dynamic content into the \texttt{HTML} body. My efforts on this project were awarded by the client.

\noindent
Using \textit{SQL Server Management Studio} for the first time, I wrote \textit{DML} capable of querying the transactional/customer databases to return data for warehousing, reporting, and segmentation. I also worked on pricing and spatial analyses, using \textit{QGIS} as a visualisation tool.
